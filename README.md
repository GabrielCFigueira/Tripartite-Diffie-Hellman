# Tripartite Diffie Hellman

**Cryptography and Security Protocols Project**.
This is our Cryptography project where we implemented the Tripartite Diffie Hellman protocol proposed by Joux in [meter o paper].
We implemented it in Python, and somes of our code is based on other libraries (for example the code to generate a field elements of a given Galois Field).
