# Tripartite Diffie Hellman

#### Cryptography and Security Protocols Project
This is our Cryptography project where we implemented the Tripartite Diffie Hellman protocol proposed by Joux in **Antoine Joux. A one round protocol for tripartite Diffie-Hellman. Journal of Cryptology, 17(4):263â€“276, September 2004.**.
We implemented it in Python, and somes of our code is based on other libraries (for example the code to generate a field elements of a given Galois Field).
